  ## Perfectionism - An origin story
  The modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device

I am a perfectionist and have been most of my life, but it is only recently that it has become a problem and it has caused me much anxiety. I have been exploring for a while what it is that has caused my perfectionist tendencies, but I only had small pieces of the puzzle. However, during a counselling session, something clicked and suddenly the entire picture became a lot clearer. So let me try to walk you through it in the hope that parts of my story are either relatable to you, or to someone you know.

### How does my perfectionism manifest?
I study, analyse and overthink before doing something. That is if I ever get to doing it. So not only does it lead to a lot of procrastination, but it sometimes even results in me not starting things to begin with. And what I find the most difficult is writing. It seems extremely daunting and makes me particularly anxious at times, particularly when I have to share it with others.

### Not fitting in as a child
I grew up in a small town in Transylvania, Romania where there were a mix of Romanian and Hungarian people. Having a Romanian mum and Hungarian dad, I was often made fun of and felt like I didn't belong because I was neither one of them. And while I now love that I got to experience two wonderful cultures growing up, at the time I didn't have the maturity to understand this. The constant voices around me making me feel inadequate left me in a constant chase of the person I thought everyone wanted me to be. Well that person didn't exist and my attempts of trying to figure out how to please everyone resulted in a lot of self-doubt and conviction that I would never be good enough.

### Studying and the educational system
With not a lot to do in a small country town, school and studying was my main "hobby" and since I didn't have many friends I was committed to proving myself by studying really hard instead and trying to be the best. Problem is that the educational system was very rigid in many ways. Mistakes were not encouraged and memorisation was rewarded more than exploring and learning in a more logical manner. So there I was, trying to please my teachers and the path to doing so was by not making any mistakes. 

### The start of my writing anxiety
I was already forming many perfectionist tendencies by the time I was 16, but then came the Romanian literature exam. A third of the exam was writing a 2-3 page essay about one of the many novels or poems that we have studied. We were therefore required to memorise many dates, quotes, verses etc. And while in most subjects I found it easy getting straight 10s, or at least understanding my mistakes, this was different. Take for example a mock exam I took a few months before the finals. I got a 9/10, which is arguably very good, but at the time it didn't seem like it. But when I asked for feedback, I was told that there was nothing wrong with my essay, but it was missing something. Knowing that I wasn't good enough at writing and no clear way to improve I felt frustrated and helpless.

### Associating writing with a negative consequences
As you can probably tell, I never really felt like I fit in at home. Despite having slowly developed some strong friendships that I cherish up to this day, it wasn't enough to keep me home, studying in a university that I was afraid would encourage the same kind of principles. I therefore decided I was going to study in the UK, where things seemed to run a little different and perhaps a place where I was more likely to fit in and enjoy what I do. So that was my way out and I needed to do well in all my exams to get into the universities I wanted, including on the literature exam. Looking back, that put a lot of pressure on me. Suddenly, not only was writing something that apparently I could never quite do well enough in, but I also needed it to get out. And it seems that I have developed this fear of writing due to the very high stakes I associated it with at the time. And I still carry that burdain with me up to this very day.

### Where I am now
While I conceptually understand why I developed my current, toxic, relationship with writing, it still feels very hard sitting down to write. I have started following a CBT guide/workbook on perfectionism and I hope that it will help me rewrite my old thinking patterns and develop new ones that enable me to find joy in writing. I will probably keep these bits of writing to myself for now but I definitely want to share this journey when I am ready.
